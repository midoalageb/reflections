How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It was much easier to see the changes made in the code by only listing the changed lines

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It is easier to track changes, rollback to a more stable code/version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, 
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Manual commits enable developer to choose logical points to save his progress, but the problem is that 
the developer can forget to do so and lose his progress

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It depends on the scope, Git deals with code in which case multiple files are most likely to change 
together, while Google Docs deals with independant documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log: prints all changes in the repository
git log --stat: provides more information on the changes
git diff first_id second_id: displays all changed lines

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I could easily use "git checkout commit_id" to rollback a change and identify the bug location

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use it to control and manage my Android Apps
