What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git starts tracking changes in the directory/subdirectories

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a temp stage between commits and it provides a way to preview what has changed before committing

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Using "git diff --staged" to compare last commit and staging area to view the changes
