What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Git starts tracking changes in the directory/subdirectories

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a temp stage between commits and it provides a way to preview what has changed before committing

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Using "git diff --staged" to compare last commit and staging area to view the changes

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Adding new features, branches will keep the main track the same and enable testing features offline with 
the ability to merge them later

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
It is easier to see which commits were added in which branch and which commits will be added/removed when checking 
out a branch

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
The result is a single commit combining changes in latest commits in both branches compared to their common parent
They are represented like this because they combine all changes in one file

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
It saves a lot of time to combine commits and only refer to the user for conflicts
