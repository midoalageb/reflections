When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I have other contributers to the project or have an online backup in case my PC crashes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if a different contributer is working on the same project and commits a branch with the
same name, I will get conflicts and have to check which commit to use
