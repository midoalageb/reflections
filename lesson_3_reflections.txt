When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I have other contributers to the project or have an online backup in case my PC crashes

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay 
up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if a different contributer is working on the same project and commits a branch with the
same name, I will get conflicts and have to check which commit to use

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork: Clones a GitHub repo to another GitHub repo. Used when I don't have permission to edit in the initial repo
or when I need to add my own version without removing credit to initial user
Clone: Clones a local or remote repo to my PC (local) repo (automatically creates a remote). Used to be able edit and
sync a remote repo locally on my PC
Branch: Used to tag a commit with a name that can be used to test out new features or add named checkpoints for the
project
